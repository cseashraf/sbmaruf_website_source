# Abstract.
abstract = "We propose an efficient neural framework for sentence-level discourse analysis in accordance with Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). Our  framework comprises a discourse segmenter to identify the elementary discourse units (EDU) in a text, and a discourse parser that constructs a discourse  tree in a top-down fashion. Both the segmenter and the parser are based on Pointer Networks and operate in linear time. Our segmenter yields an F1 score  of 95.4, and our parser achieves an F1 score of 81.7 on the aggregated labeled (relation) metric, surpassing previous approaches by a good margin and  approaching human agreement on both tasks (98.3 and 83.0 F1)."
